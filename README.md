Hey all, these are templates I've made from editing dokkan assets to be as close to the original as possible. I'm a bit new to Github in terms of uploading so it may be a bit messy.


You're free to use it and credit is appreciated. Just use a link to this page so others can use the templates here. 


Also don't expect me to be making a bunch of these constantly, haha. I'm just one guy working on these along with Xenoverse & FighterZ modding on top of Dokkan.
